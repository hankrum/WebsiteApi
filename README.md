[Test Task](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzjhILD_F2kxOld1jnFAlkoUtEGnxmFa6A5O94nk6yw/edit) Stefan Kolev Dantchev 0888-554810 stefan.kolev.dantchev@gmail.com

- steps to create the database - the database is created with Entity Framework Core Code First Approach. It is needed prior to starting the application to execute in the VS console the following command: Update-Database.

- Just start in VS and send Rest requests e.g with Postman - body - JSON

- As I work full time from home and have at present my whole family at home, my time to work on this task was mainly at night :) So there are unfinished parts - unit tests are very few only to present some idea, last minute I remembered that we need pagination and sorting, the error handling middleware can be better to match different types of exceptions.
